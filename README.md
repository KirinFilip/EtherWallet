# EtherWallet

## TODO:

- Add a function to allow the owner to change the contract's owner. This could be useful if the current owner loses access to their account or if the ownership of the contract needs to be transferred to a different account.

- Add a function to allow the owner to pause or disable the contract. This could be useful if there is a need to temporarily disable the contract in case of an emergency or security issue.

- Add a function to check the contract's owner. This could be useful for other contracts or users who need to interact with the contract and need to know the current owner's address.

- Add a function to allow the owner to withdraw a specific amount of ether from the contract. This could be useful if the owner only wants to withdraw a certain amount of ether instead of the entire contract balance.

- Add a function to allow the owner to deposit ERC20 tokens into the contract. This could be useful if the owner wants to add more ERC20 tokens to the contract's balance.
