# EtherWallet

## TODO:

- Add a function to allow the owner to pause or disable the contract. This could be useful if there is a need to temporarily disable the contract in case of an emergency or security issue.
- - Think about what needs to work when contract is paused / unpaused

- Add a function to allow the owner to withdraw all ether from the contract. This could be useful if the owner wants to withdraw all of the ether from the contract balance.

- Add a function to allow the owner to deposit ERC20 tokens into the contract. This could be useful if the owner wants to add more ERC20 tokens to the contract's balance.

- Add a function to allow the owner to deposit ERC721 tokens into the contract. This could be useful if the owner wants to NFTs to the contract's balance
